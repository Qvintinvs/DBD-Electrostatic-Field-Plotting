Electric Field Simulation and Visualization of a Coaxial Cylinder with Dielectric Layer
Overview

This project implements a numerical and analytical model of the electric field generated by a finite-length coaxial cylindrical structure with a dielectric layer, together with a 3D visualization pipeline using PyVista.

The work combines:

Electromagnetic theory

Numerical discretization

Vectorized scientific computing (NumPy)

3D scientific visualization (PyVista)

It is intended as an educational and research-oriented tool, demonstrating both physical modeling and clean, modular Python design.

Physical Problem Description

The system modeled consists of:

An inner conductor at fixed potential

A dielectric layer surrounding the inner conductor

An outer grounded conductor

A finite cylinder length, introducing edge effects

Unlike the ideal infinite coaxial cable, the finite length causes:

Axial electric field components

Deviations from the purely radial analytical solution

The electric field is computed by superposition of finite line charge contributions, and corrected inside the dielectric region using permittivity ratios.

Main Components
1. Cylindrical Geometry (CoaxialCylinder)

Generates a structured cylindrical grid with configurable spatial resolution

Converts cylindrical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates

Provides flattened arrays suitable for vectorized numerical computation

Supports both full 3D and axisymmetric (r, z) representations

Key features:

Efficient use of cached_property

Careful handling of singularities at the symmetry axis

Designed for reuse in other cylindrical field problems

2. Electric Field Model (DielectricField)

Implements the electric field for a finite-length coaxial system

Includes:

Radial and axial field components

Dielectric permittivity correction

Conductor boundary handling

Returns:

Cartesian coordinates

Unit field vectors

Field magnitude

Also includes an analytical estimate of the mean radial error caused by finite-length effects, compared to the infinite coaxial approximation.

3. Visualization (Plot)

Uses PyVista for interactive 3D rendering

Displays:

Fixed-length glyphs oriented along the electric field direction

Color mapping based on field magnitude

Coordinate axes for spatial reference

Designed to remain readable even for dense numerical grids

This separation between physics, geometry, and visualization makes the code easy to extend or adapt.
